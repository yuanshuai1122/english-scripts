### Talking About My Work – What I Do as a Software Engineer

I work as a backend software developer. Most of the time, I write code, review other people’s code, and help solve problems with systems or data.

It can be challenging, especially when there are bugs or unclear requirements. But I enjoy solving problems. It feels good when something finally works after hours of debugging.

I mostly use Java and work with databases, APIs, and web services. Even though my job is technical, I believe communication is just as important. That’s another reason I want to improve my English—to understand international documentation better and maybe even work on global projects one day.
