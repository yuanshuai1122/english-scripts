### A Message to My Future Self – To the Andy Six Months from Now

Dear future Andy,

I hope you’re still staying consistent. Learning a language is hard, but you’ve already started. Don’t stop now.

Remember how it felt when you made your first 5-minute video in English? You were nervous, but you did it. Keep doing it. Keep building that confidence.

Even if progress feels slow, trust that you’re improving. Keep recording. Keep listening. Keep speaking.

The goal isn’t perfection. It’s expression.

I believe in you.

From, your past self
