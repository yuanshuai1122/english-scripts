### Why I Want to Improve My English â€“ My Motivation

One of the main reasons I want to improve my English is to open more doors in life. I believe that language is power. If I can express my thoughts clearly in English, I can connect with more people, learn faster, and grow professionally.

Also, I just enjoy the feeling of understanding. When I watch a movie without subtitles or understand a podcast, it feels amazing.

Sometimes I feel frustrated because progress is slow. But I remind myself: fluency is not built in a day. Every small step counts.

Making these daily speaking videos is part of my plan. It helps me practice thinking and speaking in English naturally.
