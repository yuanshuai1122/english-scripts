### My Daily Routine – A Day in My Life

Every weekday, I wake up around 7 a.m. I start with washing up and sometimes reading a little bit of English while drinking warm water. After that, I get dressed and head out for work.

My commute usually takes about 30–40 minutes, and during that time, I often listen to English podcasts or repeat phrases to practice speaking. Once I arrive at work, I spend most of the day coding, attending meetings, or fixing technical issues.

After work, if I’m not too tired, I try to do something productive—like reviewing what I learned in English, reading, or just relaxing with some quiet music.

I go to bed around 11 p.m. It’s a simple routine, but I try to make each day a little better than the last.
